### Work Completed

> **User Story**
AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security

JavaScript was created to enable a user to generate a strong password depending on their selected criteria.

Functions include;
*   Selecting a password length between 8 and 128 characters. Return a message if criteria are not met
*   Generate confirm prompts to allow users to select to include lowercase / uppercase / numeric / special characters. If none are selected return a message.
*   Depending on user selection, force one type of character to be included in the final password.
*   Display the final password result on the page
